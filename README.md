# Google Play Store

This project analyses the Google play store data extracted in 2018.

**Data Set**

This data set contains 10841 apps with 13 variables on each app. These variables are: App, Category, Rating, Reviews, Size, Installs, Type, Price, Content Rating, Genres, Last Updated, Current Ver, Android Ver. After cleaning data, I have created also the 4 next columns: Main Genres, Sub Genres, Last Updated in Days, MIN Android Ver.

**Summary**

This project analizes Google Play Store, knowing the categories with the most applications, as well as the most installed or the most expensive apps.

Moreover, more than the 92% of the apps in Google Play Store are free, although the most expensive apps have been installed more than 200000 times.

Finally, regarding the content rating, the 80% of the apps are suitable for everyone.
